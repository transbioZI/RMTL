\title{RMTL: Regularized Multi-Task Learning}
\description{
This package provides an efficient implementation of regularized
multi-task learning (MTL) comprising 10 algorithms applicable for
regression, classification, joint feature selection, task clustering,
low-rank learning, sparse learning and network incorporation. All
algorithms are implemented based on the accelerated gradient descent
method and feature a complexity of O(1/k^2). Parallel computing is allowed to improve the efficiency. Sparse model structure
is induced by the solving the proximal operator.

\details{
This package provides 10 multi-task learning  algorithms (5
 classification and 5 regression), which incorporate five 
 regularization strategies for knowledge transferring among tasks. All
 algorithms share the same framework:
 
 \deqn{\min\limits_{W,C}
   \sum_{i}^{t}{L(W_i, C_i|X_i, Y_i)} + \lambda_1\Omega(W) + \lambda_2{||W||}_F^2}

where \eqn{L(\circ)} is the loss function (logistic loss for classification or least square loss for linear regression). 
 \eqn{\Omega(\circ)} is the cross-task regularization for knowledge transfer, and \eqn{||W||_F^2} is used for improving the 
 generalization. \eqn{X=\{X_i= n_i \times p | i \in \{1,...,t\}\}} and \eqn{Y=\{Y_i=n_i \times 1 | i \in \{1,...,t\}\}} are 
 predictors matrices and responses of \eqn{t} tasks respectively, while each task \eqn{i} contains \eqn{n_i} subjects and \eqn{p} 
 predictors. \eqn{W=p \times t} is the coefficient matrix, where \eqn{W_i}, the \eqn{i}th column of \eqn{W}, 
 refers to the coefficient vector of task \eqn{i}. 
 
 The function \eqn{\Omega(W)} jointly modulates multi-task models(\eqn{\{W_1, W_2, ..., W_t\}}) according to specific 
 prior structure of \eqn{W}. In this package, 5 common regularization methods are implemented to incorporate different priors, i.e.  
 sparse structure (\eqn{\Omega(W)=||W||_1}), joint feature selection (\eqn{\Omega(W)=||W||_{2,1}}), low-rank structure
 (\eqn{\Omega(W)=||W||_*}), network-based relatedness across tasks (\eqn{\Omega(W)=||WG||_F^2}) and task clustering
 (\eqn{\Omega(W)=tr(W^TW)-tr(F^TW^TWF)}). To call a specific method correctly, the corresponding "short name" has to be given. 
 Follow the above sequence of methods, the short names are defined: \code{L21}, \code{Lasso}, \code{Trace}, \code{Graph} 
 and \code{CMTL} 
   
 
 For all algorithms, we implemented an solver based on the accelerated
 gradient descent method, which takes advantage of information from the
 previous two iterations to calculate the current gradient and then
 achieves an improved convergent rate. To solve the non-smooth and convex
 regularizer, the proximal operator is applied. Moreover, backward
 line search is used to determine the appropriate step-size in each
 iteration. Overall, the solver achieves a complexity of
 \eqn{O(\frac{1}{k^2})} and is optimal among first-order gradient
 descent methods.
